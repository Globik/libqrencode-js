# libqrencode-js
Node.js addon(N-API) based on [libqrencode](https://github.com/fukuchi/libqrencode) in C - a fast and compact QR Code encoding library.
Just a little experiment with a [node.js N-API](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/n-api.html) addon

# Perfomance


* libqrencode-js is about x20 times faster than [qr-node](https://github.com/xr0master/qr-node)
* libqrencode-js is about x340 times faster than [qrcode-js](https://github.com/CloudService/qrcode-js)
